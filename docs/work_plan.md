# Phase 1 Work Planning and Division

This document captures the organisational structure, leadership rotation, and progress tracking artefacts required to evidence teamwork during Phase 1.

## Team Roster

| Member | Role Focus | GitHub Username | Responsibilities |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Name 1 | Project Lead (Week 1) | @username1 | Repository setup, data acquisition, meeting facilitation |
| Name 2 | Data Engineer | @username2 | Preprocessing pipeline, data validation |
| Name 3 | Research Analyst | @username3 | Literature review, research questions |
| Name 4 | Visualisation and Reporting | @username4 | EDA notebook, report production |

> Update the table with actual member names and responsibilities. Rotate leadership weekly to satisfy rubric expectations.

## Leadership Rotation Plan

| Week | Dates | Lead | Focus Areas |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Nov 1-7 | Name 1 | Repository infrastructure, dataset downloads |
| Week 2 | Nov 8-14 | Name 2 | Preprocessing refinement, data quality documentation |
| Week 3 | Nov 15-21 | Name 3 | Exploratory analysis, hypothesis iteration |
| Week 4 | Nov 22-30 | Name 4 | Reporting, visualisation polish, submission QA |

Adjust the schedule to your actual timeline. Ensure every member leads at least one checkpoint meeting.

## Daily Stand-up Template

```
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Facilitator: <Name>

1. Yesterday I accomplished ...
2. Today I will focus on ...
3. Blockers / help needed ...

Action Items:
- [ ] Task - Owner - Due Date
- [ ] Task - Owner - Due Date
```

Store daily notes in `docs/meeting_notes/` (create the folder as needed) to evidence consistency.

## Tracking Board Snapshot

Use a shared Kanban or maintain the table below to mirror progress.

| Task | Owner | Status | Due | Evidence |
|------|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| Data download completed | Name 1 | Complete | Nov 2 | `src/download_data.py`, log screenshot |
| Preprocessing pipeline baseline | Name 2 | In progress | Nov 4 | `src/preprocessing.py` commit |
| Literature review summary | Name 3 | In progress | Nov 4 | `docs/research_questions_methodology.md` |
| EDA notebook first draft | Name 4 | Planned | Nov 5 | `notebooks/01_phase1_eda.ipynb` |

Update daily and link to specific commits or pull requests for transparency.

## Meeting Cadence

- Daily stand-up (15 min) - asynchronous updates allowed on weekends.
- Mid-week working session (60 min) - pair programming or joint notebook walkthrough.
- End-of-week retrospective (30 min) - celebrate wins, adjust plan, reassign blockers.

Record attendance and decisions in `docs/meeting_notes/`. Screenshots of virtual boards or action lists provide strong evidence for the rubric.

## Contribution Evidence Checklist

- [ ] Each member authored at least one pull request per week.
- [ ] Pull requests include reviewer feedback and approval snapshots.
- [ ] Commit messages follow the Conventional Commits style (for example, `feat`, `fix`, `docs`).
- [ ] Capture a GitHub Insights Contributors screenshot for the Phase 1 report appendix.

## Risk Log

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data download delays | Medium | Low | Start on Day 1, verify credentials early |
| Uneven workload | High | Medium | Weekly leadership rotation, review burndown |
| Missing documentation | High | Medium | Assign documentation owner each week |

Revise the log as risks emerge and include mitigation evidence in the Phase 1 report.
